# Image Processing Toolkit

This project aims to provide users with a simple way to apply basic image processing algorithms on their images in a browser.

# Differential Equations

Originally meant to be part of a class in Differential Equations, this project also implements a simple algorithm based on a 
differential equations model.

## Inpainting

Type of image reconstruction technique, inpainting uses differential equations to predict how missing parts of an image should be filled in.

## Edge Detection

Using a model based on differential equations, more accurate and reliable edge detection algorithms can be created
